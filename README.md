# City Facility TV Displays

The City of Sault Ste. Marie uses an in-house system to display content on several display boards
located at various City facilities.  The most prominent display that uses the in-house system
is the one in the Civic Centre lobby.

As we expand our footprint, we are cleaning up the code associated with displaying the content,
and releasing it for the benefit of others.
